Reproduction of paper: Learning Discriminative Features with Multiple Granularities for Person Re-Identification

### About

This is a **non-official** pytorch re-production of paper: [Learning Discriminative Features with Multiple 
Granularities for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01438). Still **Work In Progress**.

### Implementation

![Multiple Granularity Network](/architecture.png)

* [mgn/mgn.py](/mgn/mgn.py): re-production of Multiple Granularity Network.

* [mgn/ide.py](/mgn/ide.py): baseline ResNet-50 based model, which is a rewritten from [Person reID baseline pytorch](
https://github.com/layumi/Person_reID_baseline_pytorch).

* [mgn/triplet.py](/mgn/triplet.py): triplet semi-hard sample mining loss.

* [mgn/market1501.py](/mgn/market1501.py): Market-1501 dataset.

* `Market-1501-v15.09.15/`: Market-1501 dataset root directory.

### Current Progress

* 2018-04-28: mAP=0.579464, r@1=0.798694, r@5=0.909739, r@10=0.938539
